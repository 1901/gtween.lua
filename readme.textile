h1. gtween.lua

The GTween library by "Grant Skinner":http://twitter.com/gskinner ported from ActionScript to Lua and Ansca's Corona SDK by "Josh Tynjala":http://twitter.com/joshtynjala.

h2. Usage

For those familiar with Corona, usage is very similar to "transition.to()":http://developer.anscamobile.com/reference/index/transitionto, but gtween offers a variety of useful features that go beyond Corona's built-in transitions. If you've used GTween in ActionScript, then gtween.lua should look very familiar.

bc. local gtween = require("gtween")

bc. local redSquare = display.newRect( 0, 0, 100, 100 )
redSquare:setFillColor( 255, 0, 0 )
redSquare.x = 60
redSquare.y = 60
local blueSquare = display.newRect( 0, 0, 100, 100 )
blueSquare:setFillColor( 0, 0, 255 )
blueSquare.x = 170
blueSquare.y = 60
blueSquare.alpha = 0
local function redSquareMove_onChange( tween )
	blueSquare.x = redSquare.x + 150
	blueSquare.y = redSquare.y
	blueSquare.alpha = 1 - redSquare.alpha
end
--[[
	gtween.new
	Parameters:
	1. target
	2. duration in seconds
	3. table of end values
	4. table of gtween properties (separate from tweened values to avoid collisions)
]]--	
gtween.new(redSquare, 1.5,
{
	x = 260,
	y = 260,
	alpha = 0
},
{
	transitionEase = easing.outQuad,	--standard Corona ease
	repeatCount = math.huge,			--repeat forever!
	reflect = true,						--yoyo
	onChange = redSquareMove_onChange	--called after every update
})

h2. Easing

Corona uses a non-standard signature for its built-in easing functions, but the gtween.lua port has been modified to support them. Use the @transitionEase@ property (see the example above) to tell gtween.lua to use one of the "easing functions":http://developer.anscamobile.com/content/easing designed for use with Corona's "transitions":http://developer.anscamobile.com/content/transitions. Use @ease@ (same as ActionScript) to use a standard easing function.

h2. Unsupported features

The following features from the original ActionScript GTween are not included in this port. They may be added in the future.
* GTweenTimeline
* Plugins
* Easing functions are not included, but see see the Easing section above for more information.
